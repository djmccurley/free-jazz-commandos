# Free Jazz Commandos

Free Jazz Commandos is an interactive musical experience for 1 to 4 players. Instead of defeating an enemy (or each other) or working towards a goal, the players are left to their own devices in a city block that doubles as a musical instrument. Do you work together and play something cohesive? Do you just mash buttons? Are you tough enough for free jazz?

The game borrows the visual language of hypermasculine brawlers like Double Dragon, River City Ransom and Streets of Rage. By leaving any goals, outcomes or achievements completely wide open, the experience asks players to reflect on their  built-in expectations  and biases while also inviting them to be present and listen to one another.
